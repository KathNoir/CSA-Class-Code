AP Daily Video 3.3 if-else statements

int myAge = 16;
System.out.println("Current age: " + myAge);
if (myAge >= 16) {
System.out.println("You can learn to drive a car.");
}
else {
System.out.println("You are not old enough for a license.");
}


My own try:

int points = 16;
System.out.println("Current score: " + points);
if (points >= 19000) {
System.out.println("You've gotten the highest score!");
}
else {
System.out.println("You didn't get the high score.");
}
